# Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

Hi! This repository contains a collection of files, including scripts and notebooks, showcasing my approach to analyzing real-world research projects.

The primary aim is to share how I tackle data analysis in real-life problems, often dealing with large volumes of data that needs lots of pre-proccessing and that may not be inherently related to the phenomena I aim to analyze or predict. The insights extracted from these types of analyses have resulted in published works and have undergone peer review in several scientific journals (you can see a list of publications [here](https://bit.ly/43t2L1R)).

I know this portfolio is not extensive yet (I am still working on it!) but I hope that provides an overview of some my data science skills. 

At last but definetly not least, I am always eager to take on new challenges and opportunities in science or industry related collaborations, so feel free to contact me :)  https://www.linkedin.com/in/fcavanna/.
