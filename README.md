# Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

Hi! This repository contains a collection of files, including scripts and notebooks, showcasing my approach to analyzing real-world research projects.

The primary aim is to share how I tackle data analysis in real-life problems, often dealing with large volumes of data that needs lots of pre-proccessing and that may not be inherently related to the phenomena I aim to analyze or predict. The insights extracted from these types of analyses have resulted in published works and have undergone peer review in several scientific journals (you can see a list of publications [here](https://bit.ly/43t2L1R)).

I know this portfolio is not extensive yet (I am still working on it!) but I hope that provides an overview of some my data science skills. 

At last but definetly not least, I am always eager to take on new challenges and opportunities in science or industry related collaborations, so feel free to contact me :)  https://www.linkedin.com/in/fcavanna/.

## Content

Each file within this portfolio is distinct and self-contained, covering various analytical stages of data analysis:  

### **Exploratory data analysis**
* _Code:_ https://github.com/fedecavanna/eda_psychedelics
* _Description:_ This project focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of datasets related to the effects of psychedelic use on cognition. Through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, it unveils insights and trends within the dataset.
* _Skills:_ Pre-processing, Data wrangling, Descriptive statistics, Data Visualization, Python, Jupyter Notebook.
* _Technologies:_ Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
* _Results:_ The project delivers a comprehensive, step-by-step analysis with descriptions and informative visualizations. Inspect the repository to find more information about how to use it and the data it generates.  

### **Information scrapper**
* _Code:_ https://github.com/fedecavanna/tour_scrapper
* _Description:_ The project is designed to scrape information from a tourism website. By automating the data extraction process, it simplifies the task of collecting data for various purposes, such as business research, marketing, or data exploration.
* _Skills:_ Web Scraping, Data Collection, Automation.
* _Technology:_ Python, Beautiful Soup, Requests, Data Scraping.
* _Results:_ It outputs the scrapped data in JSON format, which can be used in different ways. Explore the project for more details.  

### **Data acquisition task**
* _Code:_ https://github.com/fedecavanna/mid_task
* _Description:_ The Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MID) assesses motivation and reward sensitivity, commonly used in decision-making and reinforcement learning research (e.g., marketing research). It records task-related data, including conditions, trials, responses, earnings, and can also log EEG markers, making it valuable for both behavioral and neuroscience studies.
* _Skills:_ Data Recording, EEG Integration.
* _Technology:_ Python, Psychopy, LSL (Lab Streaming Layer).
* _Results:_ The MID task records behavioral and EEG data, saving results to individual subject files. Analysts can utilize the recorded data for analyzing motivation, reward sensitivity, and decision-making processes. Explore the repository for further details on usage and data output.
